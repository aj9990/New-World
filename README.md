Just getting started.





Hi Everyone.

John here.New on GITHUB or rather any computer language. I am here to learn coz I keep asking myself why didn't I learn to code earlier when I had all the free time. Anyways better late than never. It's all intriguing to me, I mean coding in general. Like things, you could do with that. It's awesome! 

Hoping this will be a good journey for me. I Will give my best to stick to this learning, rather than leave it in the middle.  Fingers crossed.
